### Referee Scheduler -- Requirements for Web Application

1. Summary

  Collaborative development for a referee scheduler application
2.	Overview

  1.	The purpose of this application is to provide functionality of the AYSO Referee Scheduler.  The Referee Scheduler is functionality available to all registered AYSO volunteers certified as Referees or acting as Referee Administrators or their designees.  The functionality defined in this project is based on the ZAYSO system used in the 2012 AYSO National Games in Knoxville, TN and again in the 2014 AYSO National Games hosted by Section 1 in Southern California.

  1.	This project is not, by any stretch of the imagination, complete. All of the wording will need to be revised several times before it is finalized. The graphics and layout of the screens are merely to illustrate the underlying functionality of ZAYSO. The actual look and feel will be developed over time with the input of graphics designers and iterative user feedback.

  1.	This project does not yet discuss the algorithms used which will be developed in a technical specification.
